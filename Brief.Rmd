### Hypothesis
In our pre-registered proposal: "Match effects of object orientation in the sentence-picture verification task are consistently smaller than object shape, color, and size. We hypothesize that this may be due to the fact that the orientation objects are small and manipulable.  This study asks the questions if object size constrains object orientation effects, such that effects for smaller, manipulable, items are smaller than for larger, nonmanipulable objects. A pilot study yielded larger match effects for the large objects than for the small objects both in English and in Dutch speakers. In addition, a Bayesian analysis indicated that the stronger match effect occurred for the horizontal objects of English participants and the stronger match effect happened to the vertical objects of Dutch participants. The pre-registered experiment will update the design of sentence-picture verification based on our pilots and test the hypotheses in advance. A third language, Chinese, will be included to test the stronger match effect for the large objects than the small objects and to confirm the inconsistent match effects across horizontal and vertical objects. Alternative recognition trials will be triggered after each eight trials. These recognition trials are used to make sure the participants have paid their attentions on the probe sentences. Meta-analyses will be performed on the data for the three experiments. We expect that effects generalize across languages and therefore that language will not be a signficant moderator of the observed effects."

### Method
#### Participants
The participants came from three langauge backgrounds: English(the United States), Dutch(EUR students), Chinese(Taiwan undergraduates). 150 English participants were the US residents who were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Every English participant finished the experiment in Qualtrics platform and obtained US\$ 1.5 dollars as the reward. Total 128 valid participants' data (```r sum(data_US$Gender == "Female")/128``` females; averaged age is ```r round(mean(unique(data_US$Age)), 2)``` and the range is ```r paste(min(unique(data_US$Age)),"-",max(unique(data_US$Age)))```) are collected after excluded the participants who met the accidental stop and considered the equal numbers between the stimuli lists.  
The undergraudates in EUR and NCKU participated in the Dutch and Chinese versions in the laboratories of EUR EBL and NCKU LACD Lab. They obtained the course credits or US\$ 2-3 dollars as the reward. ```r length(unique(data_TW$ID))``` Taiwan students (```r sum(data_TW$Gender == "F")/128``` females; averaged age is ```r round(mean(unique(data_TW$Age)), 2)``` and the range is ```r paste(min(unique(data_TW$Age)),"-",max(unique(data_TW$Age)))```) joined the Chinese version. So far, ```r length(unique(data_NL$ID))``` Dutch students (```r sum(data_NL$Gender == "f")/128``` females; averaged age is ```r round(mean(unique(data_NL$Age)), 2)``` and the range is ```r paste(min(unique(data_NL$Age)),"-",max(unique(data_NL$Age)))```) joined the Dutch version.  

#### Stimuli and Design
64 sets of critical stimuli are decided by the language backgrounds (English, Dutch, and Chinese), the object size (Large, Small), the object orientation (Horizontal, Verticl), and the matching the probe sentence and target picture(match, mismatch). Half of the sets represent the large objects, and the other half represent the small objects. In each set two pictures show the target object in horizontal and in vertical respectively. The format of target pictures are the grey scaled jpeg files in 240 X 240 pixels. Each picture matches one of the probe sentence whereas mismatches the other probe sentence. Every probe sentence are written in English, Dutch, and Chinese for the participants in the respective langauge backgrounds. The objects are the initial nouns of the probe sentences. We used this sentence strucure according to our earlier pilot study.

64 filler pairs of sentences and pictures are decided for the demand of verification task. In each pair the picture are irrelavent to the sentence. The sentence strucure and the picture format are identical to the critical stimuli.  
  
#### Procedure
The experimental session began after 6 practice trials. Each practice trial is the sentence-picture verification task as identical to the settings of Stanfield and Zwaan(2001) and Zwaan and Pechers (2012). Because the limitations of experimental software, the English participants finished the 6 practices trials with feedback, but the Dutch and Chinese participants finished the pratice session till they correctly answered all the 6 practice trials. 
  
The experimental session had 128 trials of sentence-picture verifiaction task and 30 to 32 trials of the alternative task. For the English participants, the alternative task is the comprehension task follows the settings of Zwaan and Pechers (2012). 32 multiple choices present after 32 fillers. These trials require the participants answer the questions about the probe sentences they just read. For the Dutch and Chinese participants, the alternative task is recognition task as like Stanfield and Zwaan (2001). 30 yes/no problems present randomly between the 128 experimental trials. These problems require the participant recognize if the sentence just shown in the recent three trials or not.  

### Results  
#### Descriptive Analysis
```{r plot_3IV, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, dependson='import_data'}
require(ggplot2)
# Plot match effects across langauges, object size,  and object orientation
ggplot(DATA_3IV,aes(x=paste(Size,Orientation),y=RT,fill=Match)) + stat_summary(fun.y=median,position=position_dodge(),geom="bar") + coord_cartesian( ylim = c(550, 750) ) + scale_fill_grey(start = 0, end = 0.9) + labs(title = "Match effects of the specific object orientation across object size and langauges", x = "Object size and orientation", y = "Median RTs (in milliseconds)") + theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(), panel.ontop = TRUE)+facet_wrap(~ Lang )
```

```{r plot_2IV, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
require(ggplot2)
# Plot match effects across langauges and object size
ggplot(DATA_2IV,aes(x= Size,y=RT,fill=Match)) + stat_summary(fun.y=median,position=position_dodge(),geom="bar") + coord_cartesian( ylim = c(550, 750) ) + scale_fill_grey(start = 0, end = 0.9) + labs(title = "Match effects of the merged object orientations across object size and langauges", x = "Object size", y = "Median RTs (in milliseconds)") + theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(), panel.ontop = TRUE)+facet_wrap(~ Lang)
```

The laboratory studies showed the stronger match effects than the internet study. Although the Dutch data are being collected, the patterns of match effects are similar between Dutch and Chinese.

#### Primay analysis: ANOVA
In the pre-registered proposal:"A 2 (size) X 2 (orientation) X 2 (match) X 3 (language) mixed ANOVA will be conducted on the participants' median response times. This ANOVA will indicate the match effects interacting with object size, orientation, and languages."

```{r registered_ANOVA_4IV, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE,, results="asis"}
require(xtable)
RT_aov_3IV <- xtable(aov( RT ~ Lang*Size*Orientation*Match + Error(ID/(Size*Orientation*Match)), data =DATA_3IV), digits = 2)[1:23,]
print(RT_aov_3IV, type = "html")
```

In addition to the main effect of object size, F(1,189) = 255.95, MSE = 6015.23, p < .01, the main effects of the other three independent variables do not reach the statistical significant level (p > .05). Between the two-way interactions, only the interaction of object size and match effects was beyond the statistical significant level, F(1,189) = 7.70, MSE = 4970.03, p = .01. Between the three-way interactions, only the interaction of object size, orientation, and match effects was beyond the statistical significant level, F(1,189) = 4.37, MSE = 5764.69, p = .04. Participants' response times obviously increased with the object size, and the patterns of match effects were different between the object size. The object orientation moderated the match effects between the object size. There are no significant differences of participants' responses among the three languages.    

```{r registered_ANOVA_3IV, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, results="asis"}
require(xtable)
RT_aov_2IV <- xtable(aov( RT ~ Lang*Size*Match + Error(ID/(Size*Match)), data =DATA_2IV), digits = 2)[1:11,]
print(RT_aov_2IV, type = "html")
```

After the object orientations merged, the statistically significant interaction of object size and match effect indicated the different patterns between the large and small objects, F(1,189) = 11.16, MSE = 2703.67, p < .01.  
  
#### Primay analysis: Meta-analysis
In the pre-registered proposal: "A meta-analytic effect size of the match effects across languages, size, and orientation will be summarized. This meta-analysis will confirm that the match effects could shift with the object size and orientations but have a stable pattern across languages."  
```{r regisgered_meta, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, results="asis"}

addpoly(dat_3IV_small_meta, row = 1, cex = .65, atransf = exp, mlab = "RE model for small objects")
```

The standard effect size of match effects were estimated in the function of languages, object size, and object orientation. The meta-analytic effects were estimated in the convergence of the orientation and the size. The  match advantage of the large and vertical objects was indicated by the meta-analytic effect. These objects further contributed to the match advantage of large objects. The small objects shows the null effect but tends to the match disadvantage. After the Dtuch data accumulated beyond 50 participants, the match effect of small objects will be confirmed.    

*Question:* How to report the standard effect size in the paper?    
  
#### Secondary analysis: Bayes Factors
In the pre-registered proposal: "We calculate Bayes factor of each match effect as the evidence resulted from the given object size, orientation, and the participants' native language."  
```{r registered_Bayes, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", results="asis"}
## Compute Bayes Factor
require(BayesFactor)
require(dplyr)
require(xtable)
## Compute Bayes Factor of match effects
BF.dat <- NULL
BF.name <- NULL
for(i in with(data = DATA_3IV, unique(paste0(Lang,"_",Size,"_",Orientation))) ){
        BF.dat <- c(BF.dat, extractBF(ttestBF( unlist( select( filter(DATA_3IV, Lang == unlist(strsplit(i, "_"))[1], Size == unlist(strsplit(i, "_"))[2], Orientation == unlist(strsplit(i, "_"))[3], Match == "N"), RT) ), unlist(select( filter(DATA_3IV, Lang == unlist(strsplit(i, "_"))[1], Size == unlist(strsplit(i, "_"))[2], Orientation == unlist(strsplit(i, "_"))[3], Match == "Y"), RT) ), paired = TRUE, nullInterval=c(0, Inf) ) )$bf[1] )
        BF.name <- c(BF.name, i)
}
BF.table <- xtable( data.frame(dataset = BF.name, BFplus0 = BF.dat)[c(9:12,5:8,1:4),] )

print(BF.table, type="html")
#for(i in with(data = DATA_2IV, unique(paste(Lang,Size))) ){
#        print(i)
#        plot( ttestBF( unlist( select( filter(DATA_2IV, Lang == unlist(strsplit(i, " "))[1]
#, Size == unlist(strsplit(i, " "))[2]
#, Match == "N"), RT) ) , unlist(select( filter(DATA_2IV, Lang == unlist(strsplit(i, " "))[1]
#, Size == unlist(strsplit(i, " "))[2]
#, Match == "Y"), RT) ), paired = TRUE, nullInterval=c(0, Inf) ) )  
#}
```

BFplus0 represents how much the current evidence favor the alternative hypothesis against the null hypothesis. A BFplus0 which is larger than ten represents the strong evidence. A BFplus0 which is smaller than 1 represents the null evidence.  

When the prior is 0.707, Bayes factors show the strong evidence for the large and vertical objects from the English participants. The evidences from the Dutch participants will settle down in the end of the evidence.    
  
#### Secondary analysis: Changes among stimuli lists
In the pre-registered proposal: "A participant will be assigned one of the four stimulus lists due to the counter-balanced within-participant conditions. A mixed ANOVA including the list as the independent variable will confirm its insignificant affection on the participants' responses."  
```{r registered_Lists, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, results="asis"}
require(xtable)
RT_aov_3IV_list <- with(data = DATA_3IV,
                 xtable(aov(RT ~ Lang*List*Size*Orientation*Match + Error(ID/(Size*Orientation*Match) ) ))   )[c(2,4,7:9,12:14,17:19,22:24,27:29,32:34,37:39),]
print(RT_aov_3IV_list, type = "html")
```

The 4-way repeated measurement ANOVA shows the null effect of the stimuli lists, F < 1. On the ohter hand, the stimuli lists interacted with the object size, F(3, 180) = 3.63, MSE = 5812.51, p = .014, and the match effect, F(3, 180) = 4.43, MSE = 5542.77, p = .005.  

#### Secondary analysis: Comprehension and Recognition task
In the pre-registered proposal: "The average accuracies of the recognition trails and the comprehension task will be summarized by the participant. The average accuracy of every language group is compared to 50% which assume the participant had not read the probe sentence carefully. In the laboratory experiment, thirty recognition trials randomly present between the experimental trails. In the internet experiment, 32 comprehension trials present after the filler items."

```{r registered_task, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
require(xtable)
TEST_Results <- unlist( with(filter(DATA_3IV, Size == "Large", Orientation == "H", Match == "Y"), tapply(MEM_ACC, Lang, t.test, mu=50, alternative = "greater")))
TEST_Table <- xtable(matrix(as.numeric(TEST_Results[grep("statistic.t|df|p.value|estimate.mean",names(TEST_Results))]),nc=4, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(c("Chinese","Dutch","English"),c("t","df","p value","Averaged Accuracies(%)")))[,c(4,1:3)], digits=2)
print(TEST_Table, type="html")
```     

Each group of participants complete the second task in the accuracies significantly higher than 50%.   

### Discussion
We could measure the match effects of object orientation when the object size was controlled. It is to be confrimed how the match effects change with the language backgrounds.  
The large objects show the match advantage of object orientation for the three languages. The small objects tend to cause the match disadvantage of object orientation. The comparison between the three languages shows the Chinese would barely simulate the orientation of small object. We need to investigate the specific features of the Chinese scripts.
