# Matching of Explicit Comprehension and Implicit Simulation

This local repository is under the version control to trace the development of experimental scripts and materials. The transformation of raw data is through the [OSF repo](https://osf.io/vfw5j/). 

The materials for presentation are collected in this repo. The previous projects are needed. [Action-Object Simulation](https://osf.io/e2npq/) collects the materials and data will be submitted to Plos One. The local repo are [201404_Craw](D:\core\Research\projects\Embodied\EXPDATA\ActionObject\201404_Craw) and [201403_GaT](D:\core\Research\projects\Embodied\EXPDATA\ActionObject\201403_GaT). **201403_Gat** had been presented in ESLP 2014, and **201404_Craw** had been presented in ESLP 2015. All of these contents will be presented for Erasmus Psychology in 20160308.
